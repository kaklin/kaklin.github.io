In accordance with embodiments, a first counter of a plurality of counters of an apparatus receives a plurality of pulse width signals in the time domain. The first counter generates a first increment signal in the time domain from the plurality of pulse width signals based on a first row of a Discrete Transform matrix. A synchronizer of the apparatus receives the first increment signal. The synchronizer generates a first synchronized increment signal in the time domain from the first increment signal. A first accumulator of a plurality of accumulators of the apparatus receives the first synchronized increment signal. The first accumulator accumulates the first synchronized increment signal over a period of time to generate a first frequency domain signal.
