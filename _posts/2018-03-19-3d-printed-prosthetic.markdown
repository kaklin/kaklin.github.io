Over the last few months I've been involved in a student society project with the ambitious goal of designing and fabricating a hand prosthetic. 
Here's the first time we got the prototype to grip anything.

The prosthetic uses an electromyography (EMG) sensor for control - here's one of the first tests using the sensor output to trigger the hand.
