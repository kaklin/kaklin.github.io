An imaging sensor includes a pixel array containing photodiodes, the photodiodes being isolated from one another by full thickness deep trench isolations. Row control circuitry controls which rows of the pixel array operate in an imaging mode and which rows of the pixel array operate in an energy harvesting mode, on a row by row basis. Switch circuitry selectively connects different groups of photodiodes in rows operating in the energy harvesting mode into forward biased series configurations between a voltage output line and a ground line, or into forward biased parallel configurations between the voltage output line and the ground line.
